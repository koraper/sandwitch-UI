# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a new repository called "sandwitch-UI" that appears to be a VS Code workspace project. The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal structure.

## Current State

- This is a fresh repository with only Git configuration and VS Code workspace files
- No package.json, source code, or build configuration files are present yet
- The repository appears to be set up as a UI project based on the name
- VS Code workspace configuration is present in `sandwitch-UI.code-workspace`

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the specific build, test, and development commands are not yet defined. Future instances should:

1. Check for the presence of package.json or other configuration files to determine the technology stack
2. Look for framework-specific files (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) once the project is initialized
3. Verify the presence of build tools and configuration as the project develops

## Notes

- This repository appears to be in the initial setup phase
- The technology stack and development commands will need to be determined as the project progresses
- Future instances should update this file as the project structure becomes clearer
